Some of the variables used in the configuration files are:

ansible_hostname - Hostname of the current host

hostvars - dictionary storing an entry for each inventory host. Allows the retrieval of ansible facts about remote hosts or about ansible itself (magic variables)

ansible_facts - data related to the remote system,  including operating systems, IP addresses, attached filesystems, and more.

ansible_facts.eth1.ipv4.address - ipv4 address of the remote system (using the network interface eth1)

hostvars[host]['ansible_facts']['eth1']['ipv4']['address'] - ipv4 address of the remote system identified by the "host" variable (identities of each host are defined in the iventory.ini file) (using the network interface eth1)

groups - dictionary matching for each group (groups are defined in the iventory.ini file) the hosts belonging to that group

ansible_managed - By default, it's value is "Ansible managed". The default value is used to indicate to people reading the file that Ansible is managing it, so it should not be altered.

The difference between "normal" files and template files is that template files are written in a specific language, that is then processed by a templating engine to produce a "normal file". For example, for .j2 files, the templating language is Jinja, and it is processed by the jinja template engine, that replaces variable names (that are encapsulated by {{ }}) with their values and processes instructions (encapsulated by {% %}).
