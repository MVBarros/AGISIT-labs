The outputs.tf file describes the values printed in the CLI after running the apply command.

Each output is declared in an output block. Each output block has an identifier, and some arguments. In this case, the arguments used are:
  value: The value argument takes an expression whose result is to be returned to the user. Any valid expression is allowed as an output value.
  description: The description should concisely explain the purpose of the output and what kind of value is expected.

In this case, 6 outputs are declared:
  "sec_rules": The rules of the sec_ingr security group resource declared in the "terraform-vmcloud-networks.tf" file with identifier "sec_ingr".
  "private key": the content of a private key (in this case the private key part of the keypair generated in step 4 of the assignment)
  "public key": the content of a public key (in this case the public key part of the keypair generated in step 4 of the assignment)
  "keypair": The name of the keypair resource declared in the "terraform-vmcloud-servers.tf" file, with identifier "keypair"
  "web_IPs": The name and ipv4 address of the openstack compute instance resources, declared in the "terraform-vmcloud-servers.tf" file, with identifier "web"
  "balancer_IP": The ipv4 address of the openstack compute instance, declared in the "terraform-vmcloud-servers.tf" file, with identifier "balancer"
